## 📊 KEY TALKING POINTS FOR JUDGES

- "This pipeline takes messy, unstructured data and makes it clean and analyzable"
- "It handles multiple formats (HTML, JSON, text) all in one file"
- "Automatically detects the schema - no manual configuration"
- "Real-world use case: web scraping, API data consolidation, log processing"
- "Can process thousands of files automatically with watch mode"
- "Optional database storage for larger datasets"
- "Works completely offline - privacy-first approach"
